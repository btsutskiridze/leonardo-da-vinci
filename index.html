          <p class="about-prg">
            Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect,
            inventor, military engineer and draftsman — the epitome of a true
            Renaissance man. Gifted with a curious mind and a brilliant
            intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which
            greatly informed his work. His drawings, paintings and other works
            have influenced countless artists and engineers over the centuries.

              Leonardo is widely considered the first engineer to be credited
              with designs for man-powered flight. The discoveries made during
              countless dissections of bird and bat wings are evident in the
              designs for the Ornithopter, a device that flies by flapping
              winged appendages. The influence of his drawings can clearly be
              seen throughout flight designs for the next 400 years.

              Not impressed yet? How about the fact that Leonardo casually
              pioneered the car? The self-propelled cart, allegedly designed for
              theatrical use, was designed to move without being pushed. Powered
              by coiled springs, it also featured braking and pre-programmable
              steering systems.

              In conjunction with his studies of flight, Leonardo conceived a
              new design for an Anemometer, a device that measures the speed of
              wind. Adapted from an original design by Leon Batista, Leonardo's
              additions made the device considerably more accurate. Always doing
              things with style, Leonardo's anemometer is also a beautiful thing
              to look at.

            <p class="invention-paragraps" id="cannon-text">
              Leonardo was heavily preoccupied by the inadequacies of
              contemporary warfare, frustrated particularly by the time-lag
              between rounds of cannon fire, caused by the necessity to reload.
              Leonardo devised a multi-barrelled cannon that could be rotated to
              fire a line of cannons whilst another was being reloaded: an early
              ancestor of the modern day machine gun.
